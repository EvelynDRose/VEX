Right now I only have one Project which is my VEX-U robot. I plan to work on more in the future.
Currently, I'm on the AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) team. I have just started so I don't have much content for that yet.

For this robot, we used a program called PROS to program it with C++.

Our task was to build and program a robot that can stack cubes and place them in the goals aswell as lift cubes up into towers.
Our competition consists of a 45 second autonomous section and 1 minute and 15 seconds of driver control.

We competed on 02/21/2020 at the South Texas Qualifying Tournament.
While we didn't win the tournment, we did win the Excellence Award. This award is the "Top All Around Team".

VEX's definition of the Excellence award: 
"The Excellence Award is the highest award presented in the VEX Robotics competition. 
This award is presented to a team that exemplifies overall excellence in building a high-quality robotics program. 
This team is a strong contender in numerous award categories."

Because we won this award, we are able to compete at Worlds which is held in Louisville Kentuky. 
At this event we will be facing other teams who have won the tournment and the Excellence award.
